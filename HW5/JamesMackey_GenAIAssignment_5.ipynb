            "and his eyes swam in a blur of water , which overflowed when he winked , \r\n",

            "there was a dark expanse of unirrigated soil that spread downward in\r\n",
            "front and backward around his neck . Mary took him in hand , and when she\r\n",

            "color , and his saturated hair was neatly brushed , and its short curls\r\n",
            "wrought into a dainty and symmetrical general effect . [ He privately\r\n",
            "smoothed out the curls , with labor and difficulty , and plastered his\r\n",
            "hair close down to his head ; for he held curls to be effeminate , and his\r\n",
            "own filled his life with bitterness . ] Then Mary got out a suit of his\r\n",
            "clothing that had been used only on Sundays during two years—they were\r\n",
            "simply called his “other clothes”—and so by that we know the size of his\r\n",
            "wardrobe . The girl “put him to rights” after he had dressed himself ; \r\n",
            "she buttoned his neat roundabout up to his chin , turned his vast shirt\r\n",
            "collar down over his shoulders , brushed him off and crowned him with\r\n",
            "his speckled straw hat . He now looked exceedingly improved and\r\n",
            "uncomfortable . He was fully as uncomfortable as he looked ; for there\r\n",
            "was a restraint about whole clothes and cleanliness that galled him . He\r\n",
            "hoped that Mary would forget his shoes , but the hope was blighted ; she\r\n",
            "coated them thoroughly with tallow , as was the custom , and brought\r\n",
            "them out . He lost his temper and said he was always being made to do\r\n",

            "and the other always remained too—for stronger reasons . The church’s\r\n",

            "small trifle or other for a couple of blue ones . He waylaid other\r\n",

            "elderly man , interfered ; then turned his back a moment and Tom pulled a\r\n",
            "boy’s hair in the next bench , and was absorbed in his book when the boy\r\n",
            "turned around ; stuck a pin in another boy , presently , in order to hear\r\n",

            "class were of a pattern—restless , noisy , and troublesome . When they came\r\n",
            "to recite their lessons , not one of them knew his verses perfectly , but\r\n",
            "had to be prompted all along . However , they worried through , and each\r\n",
            "got his reward—in small blue tickets , each with a passage of Scripture\r\n",
            "on it ; each blue ticket was pay for two verses of the recitation . Ten\r\n",
            "blue tickets equalled a red one , and could be exchanged for it ; ten red\r\n",
            "tickets equalled a yellow one ; for ten yellow tickets the superintendent\r\n",
            "gave a very plainly bound Bible ( worth forty cents in those easy\r\n",
            "times ) to the pupil . How many of my readers would have the industry and\r\n",
            "application to memorize two thousand verses , even for a Doré Bible ? And\r\n",
            "yet Mary had acquired two Bibles in this way—it was the patient work of\r\n",
            "two years—and a boy of German parentage had won four or five . He once\r\n",

            "occasions , before company , the superintendent ( as Tom expressed it ) \r\n",
            "had always made this boy come out and “spread himself . ” Only the older\r\n",
            "pupils managed to keep their tickets and stick to their tedious work\r\n",
            "long enough to get a Bible , and so the delivery of one of these prizes\r\n",
            "was a rare and noteworthy circumstance ; the successful pupil was so\r\n",
            "great and conspicuous for that day that on the spot every scholar’s\r\n",
            "heart was fired with a fresh ambition that often lasted a couple\r\n",
            "of weeks . It is possible that Tom’s mental stomach had never really\r\n",
            "hungered for one of those prizes , but unquestionably his entire being\r\n",

            "a closed hymn - book in his hand and his forefinger inserted between its\r\n",
            "leaves , and commanded attention . When a Sunday - school superintendent\r\n",

            "necessary as is the inevitable sheet of music in the hand of a singer\r\n",
            "who stands forward on the platform and sings a solo at a concert—though\r\n",
            "why , is a mystery : for neither the hymn - book nor the sheet of music\r\n",
            "is ever referred to by the sufferer . This superintendent was a slim\r\n",
            "creature of thirty - five , with a sandy goatee and short sandy hair ; he\r\n",
            "wore a stiff standing - collar whose upper edge almost reached his ears\r\n",
            "and whose sharp points curved forward abreast the corners of his mouth—a\r\n",
            "fence that compelled a straight lookout ahead , and a turning of the\r\n",
            "whole body when a side view was required ; his chin was propped on a\r\n",
            "spreading cravat which was as broad and as long as a bank - note , and had\r\n",
            "fringed ends ; his boot toes were turned sharply up , in the fashion\r\n",

            "produced by the young men by sitting with their toes pressed against a\r\n",

            "quicker a fresh - water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better\r\n",

            "was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards\r\n",

            "themselves down in the shade to talk . But the talk soon began to drag , \r\n",
            "and then died . The stillness , the solemnity that brooded in the woods , \r\n",

            "For some time , now , the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar\r\n",
